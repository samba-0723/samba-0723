# ðŸ‘‹Hi
Hi there, I'm a new member of GitHub and I'm looking forward to meeting you!

Thanks for looking at my GitHub account!

I am a Japanese student and a web developer.

I mainly develop in private repositories.

I would like to try open source development when I gain some knowledge!

Best regards!
